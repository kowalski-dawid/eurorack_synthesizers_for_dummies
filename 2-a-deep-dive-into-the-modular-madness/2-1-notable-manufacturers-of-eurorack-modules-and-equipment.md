# General Technical Requirements for Eurorack Synthesizers

Eurorack synthesizers follow a set of technical standards to ensure compatibility between modules from different manufacturers. Below are the general technical requirements:

## Physical Dimensions

- **Panel Height:** 3U (128.5 mm)
- **Panel Width:** Measured in HP (horizontal pitch), where 1 HP = 5.08 mm
- **Module Depth:** Typically ranges from 20 mm to 60 mm, but can vary

## Power Requirements

- **Power Connector:** 10- or 16-pin ribbon cable (IDC)
- **Standard Power Rails:**
  - **+12V** (main positive rail)
  - **-12V** (main negative rail)
  - **+5V** (optional, not all systems provide this)
- **Typical Current Draw:**
  - Varies per module; always check manufacturer specs
  - Most cases provide several hundred mA to a few amps per rail
- **Polarity:** Ribbon cables are keyed, but always double-check orientation to avoid damage

## Signal Standards

- **Audio Signals:** Typically ±5V peak-to-peak
- **Control Voltage (CV):** Usually 0V to +5V or 0V to +10V, but some modules use bipolar signals (±5V)
- **Gate/Trigger:** Standard is +5V, but some modules accept up to +10V

## Patch Cables

- **Type:** 3.5 mm (1/8") TS mono mini-jack cables

## Mounting

- **Screws:** M3 or M2.5, depending on the case rails
- **Spacing:** Modules are mounted side-by-side on rails, with no gaps

## Important Notes

- Always check the power requirements of each module before installation.
- Never exceed the total current rating of your power supply.
- Use proper cable management to avoid accidental disconnections or shorts.

These standards ensure that Eurorack modules from different manufacturers can be safely and reliably combined in a single system.
