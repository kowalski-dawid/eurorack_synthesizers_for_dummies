### Biography

## The Sonic Geometries of Caterina Barbieri: An Exploration of Repetition, Consciousness, and Technological Intimacy

Caterina Barbieri stands as a prominent figure in contemporary electronic music, an Italian composer and musician currently based in Milan. Her artistic practice delves into the psycho-physical effects of repetition and pattern-based operations within music. Through meticulous investigation of the polyphonic and polyrhythmic capabilities of sequencers, she crafts intricate sonic architectures that unfold in time and space. Barbieri is recognized as a leading force in the evolving landscape of modular synthesizer music, her work often characterized by a minimalist aesthetic and an exploration of themes encompassing machine intelligence and object-oriented perception. Critics have lauded her sonic creations as a "mind-altering journey" and a "dreammachine for the ears," a sentiment echoed by Pitchfork. Her music distinguishes itself through an ecstatic intensity and a profound emotional resonance, carving a unique space far removed from conventional new age or contemporary synth trends. The early recognition from a publication like Pitchfork, coupled with the clear differentiation of her sound from established genres, suggests that Barbieri's artistic vision possessed an immediate originality and impact within the electronic music community.

Born in Bologna, Italy, on September 14, 1990, Caterina Barbieri embarked on a rigorous path of musical education. Her formal training commenced with a diploma in classical guitar, earned in 2012 under the tutelage of Walter Zanetti at the Conservatorio G.B. Martini in Bologna. This classical foundation provided her with a deep understanding of musical theory and performance practice. Continuing her studies at the same conservatory, she obtained a diploma in electroacoustic composition in 2014, benefiting from the guidance of Francesco Giomi. This formal engagement with electronic sound composition signifies a deliberate move towards her current artistic focus. Her educational journey also included periods of study at the Royal College of Music and the Elektronmusikstudion (EMS) in Stockholm. The time spent at EMS, a highly regarded institution for electronic music, proved to be a pivotal point in her development as a composer. Beyond her formal music training, Barbieri pursued academic studies, earning a Bachelor's degree in Modern Literature from the University of Bologna in 2015. Her intellectual curiosity extended to ethnomusicology, culminating in a thesis that explored the relationship between American minimalism and Hindustani classical music. The combination of classical guitar training, electroacoustic composition studies, and her experience at EMS illustrates a deliberate and multifaceted trajectory towards electronic music composition. Furthermore, the subject of her thesis reveals a deep intellectual curiosity about the fundamental principles of minimalist and drone-based music across different cultural traditions, a connection that directly informs her artistic output.

Barbieri's initial encounter with electronic music occurred during her teenage years through exposure to noise and metal concerts. This early immersion in more experimental and sonically intense musical forms likely ignited her initial interest in the possibilities of electronic sound. A particularly formative experience was her encounter with the Buchla 200 system in 2013 during her studies in Stockholm. This specific instrument played a crucial role in her transition to electronic composition, offering a new way of listening and interacting with sound. Her debut release, _Vertical_ (2014), notably featured the Buchla system alongside her own voice, highlighting her early experimentation with this instrument and the integration of vocal elements. While the Buchla 200 initially served as a significant source of inspiration, Barbieri has expressed that her primary focus lies in the music itself rather than the specific hardware, suggesting a conceptual maturity where the instrument is a tool serving a broader artistic vision. Beyond the Buchla, Barbieri acknowledges a strong influence from minimalist composers she encountered in Bologna, whose exploration of repetition, permutation, and variation of small musical units resonates deeply with her own techniques. She also draws significant inspiration from female pioneers in electronic music such as Laurie Spiegel, Pauline Oliveros, and Ã‰liane Radigue, artists who approached synthesizers with a profound sense of spirituality. Barbieri values their intuitive and open-minded approaches, particularly Radigue's meditative practice with synthesizers and her engagement with Eastern philosophy. This admiration for these female figures reveals a connection to a tradition within electronic music that emphasizes intuition, spirituality, and a deep engagement with the sonic medium beyond purely technical concerns. Her influences extend further to the abstract realms of metal and noise, the intricate design of minimal and just-intonation music, and the compositional techniques of early music, particularly canons and additive patterns. The impact of Hindustani classical music, stemming from her academic research, is evident in her use of drone and cyclical structures. She also acknowledges the influence of the early 2000s computer music scene and the sonic impact of specific performance spaces like Kraftwerk. The Buchla 200 served as a pivotal catalyst in her artistic development, shifting her focus towards electronic composition and influencing her early sonic explorations. Her later emphasis on the musical outcome over the specific hardware indicates a deeper engagement with the conceptual and sonic possibilities of electronic music.

At the core of Caterina Barbieri's musical style lies an exploration of consciousness and the psychoacoustic effects of repetition. Her compositions heavily utilize modular synthesis, initially focusing on the Buchla 200 and later incorporating Eurorack systems. Her approach is often minimalist, characterized by a "no-frills" aesthetic that emphasizes the fundamental elements of sound and rhythm. Barbieri's work is marked by a focus on pattern-based operations, recursive elements, and intricate sequencing techniques, which she employs to create hypnotic and evolving sonic landscapes that often induce trance-like states in the listener. Her music seamlessly blends experimental, dance, and electro-acoustic elements, resulting in works of ecstatic intensity and profound emotional impact. It is frequently described as a "mind-altering journey" and a "dreammachine for the ears," capturing its transformative and immersive qualities. Central to understanding Barbieri's artistic intent is her philosophy of "radical immanence." This concept describes the immediate and profound connection experienced through sound, where sound waves hitting the ear are transduced into electrical impulses, causing the listener to vibrate in sync with the surrounding air, thus creating an unexpected connection with their immediate environment. She views this as a way of uniting the physical world with the metaphysical, the material and immaterial, anchoring the listener in a single moment while simultaneously allowing them to traverse the expanse of time. The concept of "radical immanence" suggests a deliberate intention to create a deeply embodied and transformative listening experience, blurring the lines between the physical and metaphysical through sound. Furthermore, Barbieri considers live performance as an integral part of her compositional development, describing it as a "living organism" where music unfolds and grows with the artist. She embraces unpredictability and chaos in her live performances, indicating a dynamic and evolutionary aspect to her music, where pieces are not fixed entities but rather processes that develop through interaction with the performance context and audience.

Caterina Barbieri's discography showcases a consistent exploration of her core sonic and thematic interests. Her debut solo album, _**Vertical**_ (2014, Cassauna/Important Records), was composed for the Buchla 200 system and her own vocals, merging different sonic eras and drawing connections between minimal techno and drone music. It stands as a meditation on primary waveforms and the polyrhythm of harmonics in synthetic sounds. Her breakthrough album, _**Patterns of Consciousness**_ (2017, Important Records), was composed using only the ER-101 four-track sequencer and a harmonic oscillator, exploring the psycho-physical effects of sound on consciousness through the repetition and permutation of patterns. This album garnered significant critical acclaim, being recognized as one of the best releases of the year and the decade by various publications and described as spellbinding in its intricacy and pop appeal, influenced by Indian classical music's concept of sound as an agent of change. Following this, _**Born Again in the Voltage**_ (2018) featured four tracks for Buchla 200, vocals, and cello recorded at EMS Stockholm, receiving positive reviews, including from Pitchfork, and explored rhythm, harmony, and timbre using sustained tones through a subtractive compositional approach. _**Ecstatic Computation**_ (2019, Editions Mego) further solidified her reputation, earning critical acclaim and being named record of the year on Bleep. Its lead single, "Fantas," was noted for its evocative quality, suggesting the life and death of a star, and the album was described as the "work of a hyper-intelligent android who has discovered human emotions", also being included among the best Italian records of the decade by Rolling Stone Italia. _Ecstatic Computation_ is seen as a celebration of the boundless possibilities of technology, exploring trance-like states and the transcendental potential of sound. In 2022, Barbieri released _**Spirit Exit**_ (Light-years), her first album on her own label. Recorded during the COVID-19 lockdown in Milan, it marked the first instance of strings, guitar, and vocals appearing in her solo work alongside synthesizers, resulting in a more taut and condensed sound that expanded her signature synthesizer sound to encompass a wider sonic universe. NPR described it as deeply psychedelic and subversive, exploring themes from sacred music and female mysticism to cyberculture and post-humanist theories. Her most recent studio album, _**Myuthafoo**_ (2023, Light-years), is a suite of compositions recorded concurrently with _Ecstatic Computation_, exploring the intersection of technology and biology and considered a sister album released on her own label, continuing her exploration of radical immanence and hinting at an interconnected ecosystem of technology, biology, and time.
