# The History of Eurorack Synthesizers

The development of modular synthesizers spans several decades, evolving from large, experimental systems to the compact and accessible Eurorack format. The table below highlights key milestones in the history of modular synthesis.

| No. | Year           | Event |
| --- | -------------- | ----- |
| 1   | 1960s          | **Early Modular Synths:** Pioneers like Robert Moog and Don Buchla develop the first modular synthesizer systems, introducing voltage control and patchable modules. |
| 2   | 1970s          | **Commercial Expansion:** Modular systems become more widely available, but are still large, expensive, and mainly used in studios and academia. Companies like Moog, ARP, and Roland contribute to the market. |
| 3   | 1980s          | **Decline and Miniaturization:** Modular synthesis declines in popularity due to the rise of compact, affordable digital synthesizers and polyphonic keyboards. |
| 4   | 1995           | **Birth of Eurorack:** Dieter Doepfer introduces the Eurorack format with the A-100 system, making modular synthesis more affordable and compact. |
| 5   | Late 1990s     | **Initial Adoption:** Early adopters in Europe begin exploring Eurorack systems, attracted by their flexibility and lower cost compared to legacy formats. |
| 6   | Early 2000s    | **Boutique Growth:** Small companies and DIY builders start producing unique and experimental modules, expanding the Eurorack ecosystem. |
| 7   | 2005           | **Diverse Module Development:** Manufacturers like Analogue Systems and Analogue Solutions join the market, increasing module variety and appeal. |
| 8   | 2009           | **US Expansion:** Companies like Make Noise and Tiptop Audio enter the scene, bringing innovative designs and expanding Eurorack’s creative possibilities. |
| 9   | 2010           | **Renaissance:** Global interest in modular synthesis surges, with more manufacturers and increased accessibility. Modular systems become more common in music production and live performance. |
| 10  | 2011–2015      | **Mainstream Integration:** Eurorack sees widespread adoption across genres. Companies like Mutable Instruments, Intellijel, and 4ms diversify the market, and digital modules expand sonic potential. |
| 11  | 2016           | **Popularity Boom:** Social media, online tutorials, and a growing community help popularize Eurorack. More musicians and producers integrate modular systems into their setups. |
| 12  | 2017–2019      | **Cultural Phenomenon:** Modular synthesis becomes a movement, with dedicated events (like Superbooth) and a flourishing DIY culture. The global community expands rapidly. |
| 13  | 2020–present   | **Sustained Growth:** Despite global challenges, the Eurorack market thrives. New companies emerge, established brands innovate, and modular synthesis is recognized as a powerful tool for music production, sound design, and live performance. |
