# Eurorack Modular Power Supply

A reliable power supply is essential for any Eurorack synthesizer system. All modules require stable and clean power to function correctly and safely. Below is a rundown of the power requirements for Eurorack modules and important considerations for powering your system.

---

## Standard Power Requirements

- **Voltage Rails:**  
  - **+12V** (main positive rail, required by all modules)  
  - **-12V** (main negative rail, required by most modules)  
  - **+5V** (optional, used by some digital modules)

- **Connectors:**  
  - 10-pin or 16-pin IDC ribbon cables are standard for connecting modules to the power bus board.

- **Current Draw:**  
  - Each module specifies its current draw for each rail (e.g., +12V, -12V, +5V).  
  - Always add up the current requirements of all modules and ensure your power supply can provide at least 20–30% more than the total needed.

## Types of Power Supplies

- **Internal Power Supplies:**  
  Installed inside the case, directly connected to mains power. Common in larger or studio cases.

- **External Power Bricks:**  
  Use an external AC adapter or brick, with a power distribution board inside the case. Popular for portable and smaller cases.

- **Bus Boards:**  
  Distribute power from the main supply to each module via ribbon cables. Some include additional filtering for noise reduction.

## Powering Different Types of Modules

- **Analog Modules:**  
  Usually require only +12V and -12V rails. Current draw is typically lower than digital modules.

- **Digital Modules:**  
  May require significant +5V current in addition to +12V and -12V. Always check the module’s specifications.

- **High-Power Modules:**  
  Some modules (e.g., complex oscillators, granular processors) can draw a lot of current. Plan your power budget accordingly.

## Maintaining Polarity

> **Important:**  
> Always double-check the orientation of your ribbon cables before powering on your system.  
> - Most modules and bus boards are keyed to prevent incorrect connections, but not all.  
> - Reversing polarity can permanently damage your modules.  
> - The red stripe on the ribbon cable usually indicates the -12V rail—ensure it matches the -12V marking on both the module and the bus board.

## Tips for Safe Power Management

- Never exceed the total current rating of your power supply.
- Leave a safety margin (20–30%) above your calculated total current draw.
- Use high-quality power supplies and distribution boards to minimize noise and voltage drops.
- Regularly check connections and avoid loose or damaged cables.

A well-designed power system is the foundation of a reliable and safe Eurorack setup. Always consult your module and case documentation for specific requirements.
