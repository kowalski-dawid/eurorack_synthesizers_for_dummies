# Module Types

## Module Types

Eurorack synthesizer systems are built from a wide variety of modules, each serving a specific function. Below are the main categories of Eurorack modules, along with three of the most popular modules in each category.

***

### 1. Oscillators (VCOs)

Oscillators generate the raw audio signals used as the basis for synthesis.

* **Mutable Instruments Plaits**\
  Versatile digital macro-oscillator with multiple synthesis models.
* **Make Noise DPO**\
  Dual analog oscillator with complex FM and wave-shaping capabilities.
* **Intellijel Dixie II+**\
  Compact, precise analog oscillator with multiple waveform outputs.

***

### 2. Filters (VCFs)

Filters shape the harmonic content of audio signals by attenuating certain frequencies.

* **Mutable Instruments Ripples**\
  Smooth-sounding multimode filter with built-in VCA.
* **Doepfer A-124 Wasp Filter**\
  Classic, characterful filter with a distinctive sound.
* **Intellijel Polaris**\
  Multi-mode filter with extensive modulation options.

***

### 3. Envelope Generators (EGs)

Envelopes control the dynamics of a sound, typically shaping amplitude or filter cutoff over time.

* **Make Noise Maths**\
  Flexible function generator that can act as an envelope, LFO, and more.
* **Intellijel Quadra**\
  Four-channel envelope generator with optional expander.
* **Doepfer A-140 ADSR**\
  Classic analog ADSR envelope generator.

***

### 4. Low-Frequency Oscillators (LFOs)

LFOs produce slow, repeating waveforms used for modulation.

* **Xaoc Devices Batumi**\
  Quad digital LFO with multiple modes and sync options.
* **Mutable Instruments Tides**\
  Versatile modulation source and LFO.
* **Doepfer A-145 LFO**\
  Simple, reliable analog LFO.

***

### 5. Mixers

Mixers combine multiple audio or CV signals into a single output.

* **Intellijel Mixup**\
  Compact stereo mixer for audio signals.
* **Doepfer A-138**\
  Classic 4-channel mixer for audio or CV.
* **Mutable Instruments Shades**\
  3-channel mixer/attenuverter for audio or CV.

***

### 6. Sequencers

Sequencers generate patterns of control voltages to automate musical sequences.

* **Make Noise Ren√©**\
  Cartesian sequencer with touch interface and advanced features.
* **Intellijel Metropolis**\
  Intuitive step sequencer with unique performance features.
* **Malekko Varigate 8+**\
  Powerful 8-channel sequencer for gates and CV.

***

### 7. Effects

Effects modules process audio signals to add reverb, delay, distortion, and more.

* **Mutable Instruments Clouds**\
  Granular audio processor for real-time sound manipulation.
* **4ms Dual Looping Delay**\
  Stereo digital delay with looping and modulation.
* **Tiptop Audio Z-DSP**\
  Open-platform digital effects processor.

***

### 8. Utilities

Utility modules perform essential tasks such as mixing, attenuating, inverting, and logic processing.

* **Mutable Instruments Links**\
  Signal splitter and mixer for audio/CV.
* **Intellijel Buffered Mult**\
  Buffered multiple for splitting signals without loss.
* **Doepfer A-185-2 Precision Adder**\
  CV adder and bus access module.

***

These categories and modules form the backbone of most Eurorack systems, allowing for endless combinations and creative possibilities.
