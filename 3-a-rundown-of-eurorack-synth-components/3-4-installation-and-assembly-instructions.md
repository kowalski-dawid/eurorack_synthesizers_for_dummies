# Installation and Assembly Instructions

Building your first Eurorack synthesizer system is an exciting and rewarding process. This guide will walk you through the essential steps to assemble your modular synth safely and efficiently.

---

## 1. Plan Your System

- **Define Your Goals:** Decide what kind of sounds or functions you want (e.g., drums, ambient textures, sequencing).
- **Research Modules:** Use online resources like [ModularGrid](https://www.modulargrid.net/) to plan your rack and check power requirements.
- **Budget:** Set a realistic budget for your case, power supply, and modules.

---

## 2. Gather Your Components

- **Case:** Choose a case that fits your planned modules and allows for future expansion.
- **Power Supply:** Ensure your power supply can handle the total current draw of all modules, with a 20–30% safety margin.
- **Modules:** Purchase your chosen modules from reputable dealers or second-hand markets.
- **Patch Cables & Screws:** Get enough patch cables and the correct screws (M3 or M2.5) for mounting.

---

## 3. Install the Power Supply

- **Read the Manual:** Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for installing the power supply.
- **Safety First:** If your power supply connects to mains electricity, ensure it is unplugged during installation.
- **Mount the Power Supply:** Secure it inside the case and connect the bus boards if required.

---

## 4. Mount the Modules

- **Check Polarity:** Before connecting power, verify the orientation of the ribbon cable. The red stripe usually indicates the -12V rail.
- **Connect Ribbon Cables:** Attach the ribbon cable from each module to the bus board, ensuring correct alignment.
- **Secure Modules:** Use the appropriate screws to mount modules to the rails, leaving enough space for ventilation.

---

## 5. Power On and Test

- **Double-Check Connections:** Ensure all cables are secure and correctly oriented.
- **Power Up:** Switch on the power supply and check that all modules power up correctly (LEDs, displays, etc.).
- **Test Functionality:** Patch basic connections to verify that each module is working as expected.

---

## 6. Patch and Play

- **Experiment:** Start patching cables between modules to explore different sounds and functions.
- **Document:** Keep notes or photos of patches you like for future reference.

---

## 7. Maintenance and Safety

- **Regular Checks:** Periodically check connections and screws for tightness.
- **Avoid Overloading:** Never exceed your power supply’s current rating.
- **Cleanliness:** Keep your system dust-free and avoid liquids near your synth.
